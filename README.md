# CS210-Data-Science-Project

This project aims to analyze the relationship between my screen time and calendar events, focusing on how exams and holidays influence both total screen time and its content, such as app categories. By combining personal screen time data exported from my smartphone and laptop, which provides daily usage duration and app-specific breakdowns (e.g., social media, productivity), with calendar data that categorizes events as "Exam," "Holiday," or other, I plan to uncover patterns and insights that could help manage time more effectively during different life events. The analysis will involve data preparation steps such as exporting and preprocessing data to align calendar events with screen time entries and categorizing apps into broader groups like social, educational, and entertainment. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I will analyze trends in total screen time and category-wise usage during exams, holidays, and regular days while also comparing patterns across different day types, such as weekdays versus weekends. The findings will be visualized through time-series charts to depict screen time trends, bar or pie charts to show app category distributions, and heatmaps to highlight variations by day type. The project aims to determine how screen time shifts during exams and holidays and identify app categories with significant changes in usage during these periods. While addressing potential limitations such as incomplete event logs or untracked app usage, I also aim to explore additional life events like vacations or social gatherings in future studies. Overall, this project will provide insights into personal time management and identify potential areas to optimize screen usage for productivity or relaxation.
